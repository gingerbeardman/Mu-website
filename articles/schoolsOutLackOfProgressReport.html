        <center><h1>Current State:</h1></center>
        <center>Between finals, fixing the 3DS port of RetroArch and being stuck on the touchscreen test the emulator is in around the same state as a month ago usability wise.</center>
        <center>There have been positive developments though and I have no plan on giving up until it finished.</center>
        <center><h1>Whats New:</h1></center>
        <center>I am pretty sure the touchscreen issue is undocumented I/O not being emulated as the touch chip emulation should be cycle accurate now.</center>
        <center>Someone with a Palm m515 is helping me run hardware tests.</center>
        <center>The code has been cleaned up alot.</center>
        <center>I am now writing a debugger that runs on the computer and sends commands over IR to the Palm to fetch the needed memory allowing higher quality tests and running them instantly.</center>
