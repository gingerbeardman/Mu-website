        <center><h1>I need help identifying the hardware in the Palm m515.</h1></center>
        <center>I am making an emulator for a device I dont have, its also one of the few devices that hasnt gotten a quality emulator and is old enough that anything can emulate it.</center>
        <center>Since I dont have the device I cant write tests specifically for it or see whats inside it and depend solely on reference manuals and my Sony Clie being "close enough" to it to run my tests and get predictable results.</center>
        <center>This is one of the times it gets really hard to emulate a device you dont have, I dont know what touchscreen controller is in the Palm m515 or how it communicates with the CPU, POSE has no information either because this is one of there OS hacks, they write directly to the EvtGetEvent event queue, completely ignoring the hardware.</center>
        <center>Since I am trying for complete accuracy for anything that doesnt impact speed I need to emulate the touchscreen SPI shift register as well, which I cant do if I dont know the protocol, that I cant know without the datasheet, that I cant find without the chip number.</center>
        <center>I am asking that someone with a Palm m515 take the back cover off and send me hires iFixit style photos of the chips on the board where the numbers on the chips are fully readable.</center>
        <center><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+1st+Generation+Logic+Board+Replacement/447">Here</a> is an example of the kind of photos I need.(the photo at the end of the page with the logic board)</center>
        <center>Also if anyone is interested in helping me setup a website for my emulator that doesnt look some crazy guys manifesto from the early 90s please contact me as well.(I suck at web/gui design and prefer working with terminals/framebuffers)</center>
        <center>As before please send the photos or links to them to "guicrith insiberia net" with the proper email symbols and stating if you want to be listed as contributing to the project on github.</center>
