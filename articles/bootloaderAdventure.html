        <center><h1>Bootloader has been dumped.</h1></center> 
        <center>The bootloader was not protected and could simply be read out once I made a tool to do so.</center> 
        <center>This is the Sony Clie PEG SL-10 bootloader since I dont have a Palm m515 and they are both Dragonball VZ.</center>
        <center>The dumping program will work on all Dragonball models(328/EZ/VZ/SZ) except 328 because it doesnt have a bootloader.</center>
        <center>If you have an undumped bootloader(which is currently all of them execpt Clie PEG SL-10) please send it to "guicrith insiberia net" with the proper email symbols added and the name of your device, I will figure out the cpu type myself.</center>
        <center>If you still use you palm device back it up before running the dumper, it will not harm the devices because everything important is in ROM but all user data could be lost if something goes wrong!</center>
        <center>The bootloader I need the most is the Palm m515 because thats what I am emulating but the others would be nice too for preservation and for MAMEs Palm driver in the future.</center>
        <center>All dumped bootloaders can be found  <a href="https://github.com/meepingsnesroms/libretro-palmm515emu/tree/master/palmBootloaders">here</a></center>
        <center><h1>How to dump the bootloader.</h1></center>
        <center><h4>Step 1:Download <a href="https://github.com/meepingsnesroms/libretro-palmm515emu/raw/master/tests/hwTestSuiteVersions/TstSuite_V2_Hex%2BBootloader%2BTrap.prc">This</a></h4></center>
        <center><h4>Step 2:Copy to a memory card you device supports(SD or Sony Memory Stick) at "/PALM/Launcher"</h4></center>
        <center><h4>Step 3:Plug in memory card and run "HWTests"</h4></center>
        <center><h4>Step 4:If you dont see "Dump Bootloader" you have an ARM device, and should stop here!</h4></center>
        <center><h4>Step 5:Navigate with the up and down keys to "Dump Bootloader" then push button 4 (Button Layout = 1,2 UP/DOWN 3,4)</h4></center>
        <center><h4>Step 6:It will look like nothing happened but only push button 4 once, go to the home screen and copy "BOOTLOADER.BIN" to the memory card</h4></center>
        <center><h4>Step 7:Take out the memory card and send me "BOOTLOADER_BIN.pdb" along with your device type.</h4></center>
